# __Introduction__

### Hi there! Welcome to the OpenSimRoot workshop! 

### In this workshop, you will learn the basics of the structural-functional model for simulating root growth using OpenSimRoot. This course will be divided into several sections that will guide you from the basics of OpenSimRoot for users to the more complex engine code for developers.

### In __Section 1__, you will learn what programs you need for running a simple simulation, how to extract your data, and how to see the 3D models of your roots.

### In __Section 2__, you will learn about root phenotypes and how to modify parameters such as root number, angle, lateral branching frequency, growth rates, etc.

### In __Section 3__, you will learn about soil parameters, including soil texture and hydraulic parameters, bulk density, and nutrient availability.

### In __Section 4__, you will learn about atmospheric parameters such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, etc.

### In __Section 5__, you will have a specific case study of how to implement OpenSimRoot for a real scientific problem.


### Before you jump into the sections, please download the following __programs__:

*  ### [OpenSimRoot and InputFiles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12LtlyuJ_TFM_pVE7Z4nMPTQpxeeCpz0h?usp=sharing)
*  ### [R and Rsudio (you will need to download both!)](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
*  ### [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)
*  ### [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
*  ### [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) 

### If you have any trouble downloading the programs or if you are a Mac user, please [send me a message](https://ilovaldivia.github.io/Lopez-Valdivia/contact.html).

# __Section 1 - Running a simple simulation in OpenSimRoot__

### Here you will run your first simulation! There are a few steps you need to perform before running the simulation. Once you have downloaded the OpenSimRoot source code and the inputfiles, you need to compile the program OpenSimRoot in your computer. For this, access to your OpenSimRoot source code using WSL into OpenSimRoot-master and run the program build.sh using the command: 

> `bash build.sh`

### If you got an error in the compilation, double check that you have the most recent version of your compilator is loaded. You can run the command: 

> `module load gcc/your_latest_version` 

### If want to know the versions available in your computer, run this command:  

> `module avail`


### Once you succesfully compiled you OpenSimRoot you are ready to run the first simulation! For that run the command:

> `./pathToDownload/OpenSimRoot_Linux_x64 -f ./pathToUnzippedArchive/`


### You can follow this process step-by-step in this [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaAmS1WnMO0&t=249s&ab_channel=ivanlopez)

# __Section 2 - Root phenotypes__

### To define the root architecture in OpenSimRoot it is necesary to edit the parameters for the root system in the inputfiles. For instance, in the InputFiles we can define the number of nodal roots, angle of emergence of the roots, lateral branching frequency, among others. For this workshop, we will use a script called __"input_production.sh"__ which will simplify this process for you. The "input_production.sh" script will edit and create new inputfiles based on the spreadsheet __"parameters_v1.csv"__, in which you will specify the root phenotypes you want. Think about it as a two step process, in which you first define your parameters in the "parameters_v1.csv", then run the script "inputfile_production.sh" and create the input files. Once you have created the inputfiles you can run the simulations. 


### So, let's explore the parameters_v1.csv file. It contains  : 

```{r data-setup, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# This code will RUN, but you will not see this block in the HTML file.

# Load the necessary libraries
library(DT)
library(readr) # Use this for .csv files

# Read the spreadsheet from the 'data' folder
# The path is relative to the root of your project
spreadsheet_data <- read_csv("parameters_v1.csv")

# Create the interactive datatable
datatable(
  spreadsheet_data,
  caption = "An interactive preview of the parameters spreadsheet.",
  options = list(
    scrollX = TRUE,
    autoWidth = TRUE,
    columnDefs = list(list(
      targets = "_all",
      className = "dt-nowrap"
    )))
)



```


### From column 1 to 7 we have the Tags. These are not parameters but simple names that you can edit when designing your simulations. For instance, in column 1 we have ACCESSION, which correspond to a particular phenotype, let's say steep or shallow roots. In the column 2 we have the environment, which we will cover in section 3 and 4. In this case, column 2 is the same for all because we are using the same environment for all the simulations. The rest of the columns have 0 because we are not using them in this example, but can be easily edited by the user as needed.

### Starting from column 8 we have the parameters of the simulation. These parameters include parameters for the root morphology, root physiology and environment. In this section we will focus only in the root morphology. In particular we will look at the columns AN_, NRN_, and MIN/MAX_BF, which represents the values for __Angle__, __Number of roots__ and __lateral branching frequency__. You will notice that the column name is accompanied by the acronyms "SEM", "N1", "N2", ... "N7". These acronyms refer to the root type the apply. For instance, AN_N1 correspond to the Angle for nodal root 1, NRN_SEM correspond to the number of "seminal" roots. 

### In the following figure you can see the results for each of the ACCESSIONS, corresponding to contrasting values for Angle, Number of roots and Branching frequecies.
