<h1><strong>Chapter 1 - Local adaptation of root traits</strong></h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="origin-of-maize" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Origin of Maize</em></h3>
<p>Maize originated in Mexico from teosinte around 9000 years ago
(Matsouka, 2002). During its domestication, maize dispersed throughout
North and South America, growing and adapting in a highly variable
geographic regions with specific edaphic constraints, giving rise to
multiple populations with wide genetic and morphological diversity
(Vigouroux, 2008). The root system is the organ in charge to respond and
adapt to any stress condition in the soil, however the role of roots
traits during maize dispersion and domestication have been neglected. In
2013, Burton et al., studied the root diversity of maize analyzing
architectural and anatomical root traits in populations of 195 landraces
and 61 teosintes from America. The mainly contribution was that maize
tend to have more seminal roots and less crown roots compared with
teosinte (Burton, 2013). However, the possibility that this root
phenotypic variation show local adaptation to their original environment
has not been explored.</p>
</div>
<div id="maize-roots-and-domestication" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Maize roots and domestication</em></h3>
<p>Root architecture is a determinant factor to adapt to edaphic stress
because it determines the spatial distribution of a root system in the
soil. Since plants need to uptake mobile and immobile nutrients the
spatial location of the roots will determine it success to capture
nutrients. For example, it has been tested that maize varieties with
higher number of crown roots tend to develop shallow angles and
distribute its root system in the shallow parts of the soils compared
with varieties with lower number of crown roots. Under phosphorus stress
varieties with higher number of crown roots perform better due to the
phosphorus is an immobile nutrient that accumulates in the shallow
profiles of the soil (Sun, 2018). In contrast, maize lines with low
number of crown roots develop steeper angles, allowing the roots explore
the deeper profiles of the soils. Under low nitrogen and water stress
maize varieties with less crown roots perform better because they are
able to reach the nitrogen and water that leach to the deeper soil
profiles (Gao 2016; Saengwilai 2014a).</p>
</div>
<div id="cheap-roots-for-soil-adaptation" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Cheap roots for soil adaptation</em></h3>
<p>The ability to reduce the metabolic cost of soil exploration is also
an important factor to adapt in poor soil conditions and it is directly
related with some phenotypic traits. For example, reducing the number of
crown roots will also reduce the respiration cost of the root system,
therefore varieties of maize with less crown root number will have
steeper angles but also less carbon requirements for respiration. The
carbon saved from respiration then could be used for growth instead
(Saengwilai 2014a). Other traits that reduce the metabolic cost is the
programed cell death in the cortex of the roots, called aerenchyma. This
trait makes air spaces in the cortex that is useful to adapt to very
humid conditions, but also to reduce the metabolic cost since there are
less cells respiring. Maize varieties with and without aerenchyma were
evaluated under low nitrogen conditions and the ones with aerenchyma
were superior to adapt in these conditions (Saengwilai 2014b).</p>
</div>
<div id="opensimroot-as-a-tool-to-study-domestication-of-roots."
class="section level3">
<h3><em>OpenSimRoot as a tool to study domestication of roots.</em></h3>
<p>These relations between root traits and nutrient capture efficiency
have been used to create OpenSimRoot, which is a structure-function
model that simulates root growth considering the root architecture, cost
of soil exploration and maintenance. OpenSimRoot has been useful to
predict the impact of root traits like number of seminal roots, number
of crown roots and aerenchyma volume in plant growth (York et al., 2015,
Saengwilai, 2014a; Postma. et al., 2011; Saengwilai, 2014b). However,
the model has been not used before to test if root phenotypes have local
adaptation. In this work, we used OpenSimRoot to design artificial
environments for high and low nitrogen fields and test if the maize root
phenotypes of landraces that evolved in those environments showed local
adaptation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Maize landraces coming from low nitrogen fields have root phenotypes
that are more efficient to uptake nitrogen in silico compared with
landraces coming from high nitrogen fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<div id="model-description" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Model description</em></h3>
<p><a href="https://rootmodels.gitlab.io/">OpenSimRoot</a> (OSR) is a
structural-functional model that simulates root growth and interaction
with soil in three dimensions. To simulate root geometry the model
assumes the hypocotyl as the starting point and roots develop from it
considering axial and radial branching (Lynch 1997). Root growth in
three dimensions is represented with static and dynamic coordinates that
store the information of the previous location (Postma, 2017). The root
architecture and hierarchical development will depend on the specie.
Actually, OSR is able to simulate root systems of barley, bean, maize,
squash and Arabidopsis (Shafer, 2019). Taking maize as example, the
first root that develop is the primary root, then seminal roots, nodal
roots and brace roots. Each root type develops lateral roots also
considering the radial and axial branching (Lynch 1997). Parameters like
number of roots, growth rates, branching density, respiration,
photosynthesis, leaf expansion rate are measured empirically and are
used in the model as input files.</p>
<p>OSR includes a carbon module, that calculates the available carbon
for growth based on a subtraction of the carbon sources minus the carbon
sinks. The carbon sinks are the root exudates and the maintenance cost
due respiration, while the carbon sources are the carbon available in
the seed and the carbon produced by photosynthesis. Some carbon
partitioning rules are that exudates and respiration are obligated cost,
once this demand is covered the remaining carbon could be used for
growth. The carbon for growth is partitioned in shoot and root, giving
priority to the shoots. OSR also includes a nitrogen module that
simulates the leaching of water and nutrients in the soil. Movement of
water and nitrate is computed by integrating the SWMS_3D model, which
numerically solves Richard equation for satured-unsaturated water flow
and the convection-dispersion equation for solute transport (Simunek,
1995).</p>
<p>To simulate stress the model calculates a nutrient stress factor
(NEF) based on the optimal nutrient concentration of the tissues. When
the nutrient availability in the simulated soil is less than the optimum
the NEF will increase. The NEF will directly impact leaf expansion rate
and light use efficiency. When leaf expansion rate is reduced, the sink
of the shoot is reduced, and carbon is allocated in the roots,
functioning as a growth regulator. In other hand, when light use
efficiency is affected, there is less carbon and a reduction of growth
in general. The impact of NEF in leaf expansion rate and light use
efficiency is nutrient specific. For example, when phosphorus
concentration is below the optimum it will impact leaf expansion rate.
When potassium is below the optimum the NEF will affect light use
efficiency, and when nitrogen is below the optimum it will affect both
(Postma, 2011).</p>
</div>
<div id="outputs" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Outputs</em></h3>
<p>The outputs of the system are “table_output.tab” files, which
contains a table with information for shoot dry weight, photosynthesis,
respiration, nutrient uptake, stress factor etc. for every time steps.
In addition, the model produces VTP/VTU files that contains the
locations of every root segments and root properties, as well as soil
properties. These files can be visualized using Paraview, in which
variables like nutrient concentration in soil and nutrient uptake by
roots can be observed trough time.</p>
</div>
<div id="genotypes" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Genotypes</em></h3>
<p>We used a root phenotypic diversity panel of 195 landraces and 61
teosintes from America (Burton 2013) to select phenotypes coming from
high and low nitrogen fields. We obtained georeferenced information for
every genotype using GRIN, USDA data base. Only 99 landraces from Burton
panel were present in GRIN with georeferenced information included. We
obtained information for total nitrogen in the soils using soilGrids
(Sousa 2020) for each line and we selected the landraces coming from low
nitrogen fields (.88 g/kg) and high nitrogen fields (5.11 g/kg). Low
nitrogen fields belonged to arid category in FAO classification while
high nitrogen field belonged to humid or sub-humid regions. Furthermore,
the predominant soil of high nitrogen fields was 40% of sand, 30% of
silt and 30% of clay, while in the low nitrogen fields it was 55% sand,
30% silt and 15% clay, corresponding to clay-loam and sandy-loam,
respectively. We integrated data for nitrogen, climatic region and soil
texture to design artificial environments for high and low nitrogen
soils, named Environment A and B, respectively (Table 1). Since the root
phenotypes from high and low nitrogen fields also showed differences, we
designed phenotypes A and B, corresponding to high and low nitrogen
fields, respectively (Table 2).</p>
</div>
<div id="runs" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Runs</em></h3>
<p>We ran six replicates of all the possible combinations of
environments and phenotypes: being Environment A-Phenotype A,
Environment A-Phenotype B, Environment B-Phenotype A and Environment
B-Phenotype B. We used a workstation in Pennsylvania State University
with 60 GB RAM memory. Simulations took 96 hours to compute. Output data
was analyzed with R and Paraview.</p>

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>During its spread through America, maize landraces have been evolving
and adapting to a very diverse soil conditions, including lack of
nutrients and water. To test if the root phenotypes of landraces from
high and low nitrogen fields showed local adaptation to their original
environments, we design artificial phenotypes and environments of these
conditions using OpenSimRoot and test their performance in all
combinations. High nitrogen soils (environment A) were represented with
an artificial soil with 83.21 Mol/ml nitrate concentration, clay-loam
soil texture and 171.3 mm of precipitation, while low nitrogen soils
(environment B) were represented with an artificial soil with 4.005
Mol/ml nitrogen concentration, sandy-loam soil and 57.1 mm of
precipitation (Table 1, Video 1). On the other hand, root phenotypes
were designed considering the angle, and number of seminal and nodal
roots of genotypes from high and low nitrogen fields. Phenotypes for
high nitrogen fields (phenotype A) were characterized for having 1 more
nodal root per node and shallower angle compared with phenotypes from

<p>Video 1. Simulation of phenotypes A and B at day 40 under both
environments. Red color in the soil represents the nitrogen
concentration. Yellow color in the root segments represent the nitrogen
uptake.</p>
<p>In order to compare the fitness of phenotype A and B under both
environments, we analyzed the values for shoot dry weight, root dry
weight and root respiration at day 40. We observed that under
environment A, the phenotype B was slightly superior on shoot dry weight
production compared with phenotype A (Figure 1A). Interestingly,
phenotype B produced less root dry weight (Figure 1B) and less
respiration (Figure 1C) than phenotype A. This could be explained
because phenotype B produced less roots and there is less maintenance
cost of the root system. Since maintenance cost represent one of the
stronger sinks of carbon, phenotype B is able to save the carbon wasted
in maintenance and invest it in growth, therefore producing greater
shoot dry weight. In environment B the variation of values for shoot dry
weight, root dry weight and root respiration are more variable compared
with environment A (Figure !), that could be associated with the
stochasticity of the model, which tend to be more significant when the
plant is under stress.</p>

alt="Figure 1: Shoot dry weight, root dry weight and root respiration for phenotypes A and B under both environments." />
To further investigate the patterns of root growth of phenotypes A and B
under both environments we looked at the root length in deeper profile
of the soil. We observed that under environment A, the phenotype A
reached deeper soil profile compared with phenotype B. In contrast,
under environment B the phenotype B produced deeper roots compared with
phenotype A (Figure 2). This is interesting because root depth has been
pointed as an important trait to adapt to low nitrogen (Saengwilai,
2014a) and water conditions (Gao, 2016). If we assume that deeper roots
is a trait associated with fitness we might have clear evidence of local
adaptation in root phenotypes of landraces from contrasting nitrogen
level fields. We also shall consider that the soil texture of low
nitrogen fields was sandy-loam, which have higher hydraulic conductivity
compared with the clay-loam (Table 1). It is possible that we are not
simulating correctly the leaching of the nitrogen in the soil. For
example, environment B have higher hydraulic conductivity, however the
reduced precipitation slows the leaching. One of the weakness of this
model is that it only simulates growth for 40 days, but if we consider
leaching in several seasons maybe the nitrogen would remain stocked in
the deeper soils and deeper root would be more important trait for
nutrient acquisition and growth.</p>

<p>The overall results of these project show that no pattern of local
adaptation was obtained in any of the variables analyzed above, with
exception of root length in deep profiles, however we cannot discard
local adaptation in these genotypes, since there are intrinsic variables
like phenotypic plasticity and soils dynamics that we are not
considering in the simulations.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Root length in the deeper soil profiles showed a pattern of local
adaptation, however values for shoot dry weight, root dry weight and
root respiration didn’t show this pattern. It is necessary to consider
nutrient leaching across more than 40 days to represent correctly the
high and low nitrogen environments.</p>
