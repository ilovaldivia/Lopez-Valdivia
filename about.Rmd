### I'm a Mexican Ph.D. student devoted to understand the physiological functions of root traits in maize and the effect domestication on them. I use greenhouse, field and modeling approaches in order to dissect the components of maize adaptation to different environments.

### I studied a master in Plant Biotechnology at [LANGEBIO Cinvestav](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/) where I dissected the root anatomy and architecture of 5000-year-old root systems of maize specimens coming from the San Marcos cave at Tehuacan Valley. I performed this research in the [Paleogenomics Lab](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/Dr-Rafael-Montiel) and [Apomixis Lab](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/Dr-Jean-Philippe-Vielle.html) at LANGEBIO, and in collaboration with the [Roots Lab](https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/labs/roots) at Penn State University. We find [evidences](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2110245119) that the roots traits were domesticated gradually in maize. Further information can be found [here](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/getting-root-corn-domestication-knowledge-may-help-plant-breeders/).

### I was so fortunate to share my master thesis work in the ["Sexto Congreso Internacional El patrimonio Cultural y las nuevas tecnologias"](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHGk6d-GebA) where I talked about how root traits were affected gradually during the domestication of maize.
