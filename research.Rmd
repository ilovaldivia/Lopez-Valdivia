# __Root cortical anatomy and nitrogen capture__

Interaction of root anatomical phenotypes, root growth, and soil nitrogen availability. Visualized output of the simulated root architecture of reduced CCFN (right panel, green), increased CCFN (right panel red), small CCS (left panel, red) and small CCS (left panel, green) under moderate N stress. The continuous gradient from red to blue in the simulated soil represents nitrogen depletion by root uptake and leaching. Simulations were performed utilizing [OpenSimRoot](https://rootmodels.gitlab.io/) (OSR), a structural-functional model that simulates root growth and interaction with soil in three dimensions.

# __Domestication of root traits in the earliest maize__

We used laser ablation tomography to characterize the root anatomy of 5,300-y-old maize specimens recovered from San Marcos (Tehuac√°n, Mexico), revealing exquisite preservation of their cellular organization. We observed the presence of Multiseriate cortical sclerenchyma [(MCS))](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2012087118), typical of extant maize adapted to hard soils.


# __Local adaptation of root traits__

We designed root phenotypes and environments corresponding to maize landraces coming from contrasting edaphic conditions. Then we reciprocally transplanted in silico to evaluate their performance.
